Welcome to my site! I have created this site with the purpose of collecting several of my passions in one same place, in the way that can act as a personal portfolio.

Here, I plan to update the state of my computational research, as well as some bioinformatics topics (or scientific topics in general) that I find interesting.

Apart of that, I also would like to share non-sciency stuff. This can be an absurd philosophical realization that came across to my mind while going for a walk, my critical view on the latest Oscar-winning movie, or my latest amateur musical composition that I share in the section [**music**](/music).
