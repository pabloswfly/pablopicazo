I have recently had the pleasure to talk about the project that I developed for my master thesis in the group of Fernando Racimo, at the University of Copenhagen. I was invited as a speaker in the Bioinfo Club April 2022, wonderfully organized by BioinformaticsGRX (https://bioinformaticsgrx.es/).

BioinformaticsGRX is an association of young bioinformaticians promoting and disseminating their love for all things bioinformatics in thousands of different ways: webinars, round tables, symposiums, workshops, etc... 

And their headquarters is in Granada, my hometown!

You can find the recorded video of the webinar below: 
(warning: it can get tech-geeky!)
