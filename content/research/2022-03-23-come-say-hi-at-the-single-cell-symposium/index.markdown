Hi frengers! (not quite friends, but not quite strangers)

I will be presenting a poster at the coming Single Cell Genomics Symposium in Barcelona on March 24th and 25th! I will take place at the PRBB, Parc de Recerca Biom√®dica de Barcelona. If you are reading this and are attending the event, come and say hi!

In my poster I will show my latest advances in developing DeepSCore, a multi-language (works in R and Python) and multi-omics (works with gene expression and genomic regions) deep learning model to automatically annotate single-cell datasets.

I will update this post with more information about it soon.

Stay tuned!
