The Single Cell Symposium was a blast! It was great to attend this conference in
person, now that it seems the covid is giving us some room to breathe (literally).


I could finally get to physically meet renowned scientist that I have been following
in social networks for long time, and the surroundings of the Barcelona Biomedical 
Research Park building where the meeting took place were idyllic. Just to show you
a peek of the views from this institute:

The talks were held from top national and international researchers in the single
cell universe, and they were all very inspiring. During the poster session, I presented
my poster on DeepSCore, a deep learning framework that I am developing to easily 
annotate multimodal single cell datasets in both Python and R using a curated reference.


It got much more attention than I expected! I literally was discussing my results
to visitors the whole time. Lots of them were interested in applying
my tool in their analyses, and I even got proposed to add DeepSCore in a Python 
single cell tool ecosystem in the future. Discussions got funnier when beers were 
served at the bar.

While being a bioinformatics scientist can feel like a lonely trip sometimes, where
it's basically you and your computer fighting with each other, these kind of days
are the ones where you can see the outreach and effects of your efforts in the outside 
world. And it feels really satisfying.
