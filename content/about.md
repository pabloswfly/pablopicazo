> print('Hi there!')

I am Pablo Iáñez Picazo, a bioinformatician and data scientist from Granada, Spain. I hold a BSc in Biochemistry from Universidad de Granada and a MSc in Bioinformatics from University of Copenhagen. Recently, I received a 'La Caixa' Foundation excellence fellowship to pursue my Ph.D. studies. I am particularly curious about the potential applications of machine learning and deep learning models in big biological data, which will pave the way towards precision medicine.

I am currently a Ph.D. student at the [**Biomedical Data Science**](https://www.isglobal.org/en/biomedical-data-science) lab at ISGlobal, led by Paula Petrone, in Barcelona, Spain. We aim to develop digital epigenetic clocks using stem cell microscopy and deep learning models.

Before this, I worked as a research assistant at Elisabetta Mereu's lab [**Cellular Systems Genomics**](https://www.carrerasresearch.org/en/cellular-systems-genomics_169432) at Josep Carreras Institute. There, I worked on single-cell multi-omics data analysis and integration using AI. I also participated in the [**Human Cell Atlas (HCA)**](https://www.humancellatlas.org/) of the human pancreas, mainly creating an atlas of open chromatin at single cell resolution.

During my master studies, I have been trained in [**Fernando Racimo's lab**](https://sites.google.com/site/fernandoracimo/) and in [**Thomas Hamelryck's lab**](https://dsin.ku.dk/key_researchers/thomas_hamelryck/), mainly developing deep learning and bayesian methods in the fields of protein structure and population genetics.

In my free time, I love discovering new music, learning to produce music, traveling and consuming plot-twist heavy stories in any medium.
