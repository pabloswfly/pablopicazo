> print('Hi there!')

I am Pablo Iáñez Picazo, a bioinformatician and data scientist from Granada, Spain. I hold a BSc in Biochemistry from Universidad de Granada and a MSc in Bioinformatics from University of Copenhagen. I am curious about the potential applications of machine learning and deep learning models in big biological data, which will pave the way towards precision medicine.

I am currently a research assistant at Elisabetta Mereu's lab [**Cellular Systems Genomics**](https://www.carrerasresearch.org/en/cellular-systems-genomics_169432) at Josep Carreras Institute in Barcelona, Spain. Here, I am studying single-cell multi-omics data analysis and integration. I am also participating in the Human
Cell Atlas (HCA) of the human kidney, mainly creating an atlas of open chromatin
at single cell resolution.

Before this, I have been trained in [**Fernando Racimo's lab**](https://sites.google.com/site/fernandoracimo/) and in [**Thomas Hamelryck's lab**](https://dsin.ku.dk/key_researchers/thomas_hamelryck/), mainly developing deep learning and bayesian methods in the field of protein structure and population genetics.
