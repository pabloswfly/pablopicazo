I have recently started composing and producing music under the artistic name

`p l o n o a`. 

This was born as a juxtaposition and personal escape of the scientific part of me, 
where I dive in into fully creative project. You can stream my first pieces in BandCamp:

I use BitWig DAW in Linux OS and MPK mini MK3 from AKAI as MIDI.
